Pride Flags Mod v1.0
By Leslie E. Krause

Pride Flags adds a variety of eight animated flags to celebrate pride in Minetest.

The flags and poles are non-craftable and intended for placement by an administrator in a
conspicuous location, such as atop a building or along a promenade.

  /giveme pride_flags:mast_lower
  /giveme pride_flags:mast_upper

Initially, the rainbow pride flag will appear when the upper mast is placed.
Right-click or punch the node to select a different flag.
