Pride Flags Mod v1.0
By Leslie E. Krause and Wuzzy

Pride Flags adds a variety of animated flags to celebrate pride in Minetest.

This adds two blocks:

* Flag Pole: for the lower section
* Flag Pole with Flag: For the top of the flag pole with a flag attached.
                       Note: It occupies 3 blocks vertically.

Initially, the rainbow pride flag will appear when the Flag Pole with Flag is placed.
Right-click or punch it to select a different flag.
